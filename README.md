# PassCheck
Password strength checker web application

A basic, very lightweight Javascript web application that tests the strength of a password and classifies it as Weak, Good, Strong or Very Strong. This is currently based on password length only, although I do plan to add further parameters in the future.

To add this to your web browser, drop all the files into your web root directory and amend as you see fit (display, embed content into an existing webpage etc.) The default index.html files is set to display a logo from an image hosted at images/passcheck.png - add an image to that location if a photo is required.
