# PassCheck
Password strength checker web application

A basic, very lightweight Javascript web application that tests the strength of a password and classifies it as Weak, Good, Strong or Very Strong. This is currently based on password length only, although I do plan to add further parameters in the future.

To add this to your web browser, drop all the files into your web root directory and amend as you see fit (display, embed content into an existing webpage etc.)
